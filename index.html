        <p>My favourite character is Twilight Sparkle from My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic. She was first a unicorn and now she is an alicorn princess of Equestria. Her mentor Princess Celestia who is the princess of the Sun. She is a bookworm who did not like Friendship first. But after having 5 friends she understood the importance of friendship and is now the Princess of Friendship. Her friend's name are- Applejack (represnts Honesty), Rarity (represents Generosity), Rainbow Dash (represents Loyalty), Pinkie Pie (represents Laughter) and Fluttershy (represents Kindness); She herself represents Magic. She has faced many villians. I like her as she is brave, Princess Celestia's star student, cute. I also like her as she is a princess and her colour are my favourite colours (pink and purple mainly). I love her a lot.</p>
